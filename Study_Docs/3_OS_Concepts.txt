## What is Paging and Frames ?


In computer operating systems, paging is a memory management scheme by which the secondery memory of the computer is divided into
same-size blocks of memory called "Pages" to solve the problem of the non-contigous memory allocation.

A computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage for use in main memory.In this scheme, the operating system retrieves
data from secondary storage, stored in pages. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating
systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.

In Case of main memory, In order to copy the data from the pages(memory blocks) of the secondery memory the memory blocks on primary
memory should be of same size. These memory blocks on the Primary memory are called "Frames"

Main Memory :   RAM (an acronym of "random-access memory")  ---------> Physical Address
Secondery Memory : Disk (a shorthand for "hard disk drive") ---------> Logical Address

Maintaning "Page Table" :
1. It is a Data structure which maintains the address of the Frame present in main memory of the corresponding Page in secondety memory.
2. Every process has a different Pages table and no of entries in the page table is equal to the no of pages in that process.

Squence for process execution :
1. CPU generates a logical address of the Page. (Logical Address contains Page number and Instruction offset).
2. With the help of PTBR (Page Table Base Register) holdes the the value of appropriate PT. PTBR is stored in the PCB (Process Control Block)
3. Now with Page no present in the logical address PC identifies the address og the corresponding frame in tne main memory and combines
    it with the instruction offset received from logical address. when frame address and instruction address comes togehter it forms
    Physical address.

Advantages :
 --Fast Access
 --No Exrernal Fragmentation.

Disadvantages :
 --Internal Fragmentation
 --Suffers from the double time for Instruction Access.(Still better than reading from the secondery)

The hardware implementation of page table can be done by using dedicated registers. But the usage of register for the page table is
satisfactory only if page table is small. If page table contain large number of entries then we can use TLB(translation Look-aside buffer),
a special, small, fast look up hardware cache.

##. What is a core dump ?

In computing, a core dump, memory dump, or system dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at
a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally.

*************************************************************************************************************************************
##. What is Segmentation Fault ?

Core Dump/Segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that “does not belong to you.”
When a piece of code tries to do read and write operation in a read only location in memory or freed block of memory, it is known as
core dump.It is an error indicating memory corruption.

## What is fpic in linux ?

The f is the gcc prefix for options that "control the interface conventions used in code generation" The PIC stands for
"Position Independent Code", it is a specialization of the fpic for m68K and SPARC.

Position Independent Code means that the generated machine code is not dependent on being located at a specific address in order to work.
E.g. jumps would be generated as relative rather than absolute.

Pseudo-assembly:

PIC: This would work whether the code was at address 100 or 1000

100: COMPARE REG1, REG2
101: JUMP_IF_EQUAL CURRENT+10
...
111: NOP

Non-PIC: This will only work if the code is at address 100

100: COMPARE REG1, REG2
101: JUMP_IF_EQUAL 111
...
111: NOP
